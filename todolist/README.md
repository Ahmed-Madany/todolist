## Description

This project is a simple and interactive To-Do List built with React.  
It allows users to add tasks, delete them, and mark them as completed.  
The application uses React's `useState` hook to manage the task list and input values.

Each task displayed in the list includes:
- A **Delete** button to remove it.
- A **Complete** button that crosses the task using a strike-through effect.

The project is styled using CSS Modules for better component-level styling isolation.
